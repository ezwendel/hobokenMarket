CS 554 Final Project

For running the project with Docker:
1. Install Docker at https://www.docker.com/get-started (You may need to make a free account).
2. Open a terminal in the root directory of the project and run the command docker-compose build
3. Once that finishes, run the command `docker-compose up`. This will start the containers, and might take a while.
4. If everything seems to be running, navigate to `localhost:3000` in your browser to open the website.
5. When finished, `^C` in the terminal to close the app and run the command `docker-compose down` to remove the containers that have been made.
